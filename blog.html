                        For the better half of 2020, I spent a lot of time reflecting on my Asian American identity. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When the COVID-19 pandemic first hit and Asian Americans were uncharacteristically placed in the global spotlight, and again when the fear that followed this sent me on an unexpected and foreign summer “vacation” in Korea, I spent a lot of time just thinking. I admit I spent an ungodly amount of time sitting in front of my computer through quarantine writing amateur blogposts on Tumblr, trying my hardest to make sense of it all. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After bleeding onto my keyboard and scrapping through dozens of drafts for the last couple of months, I finally mustered up the courage to submit to USC undergraduate history journal, The Scroll, for their 1880 Project.                     </p>
                    <p>
                        I am excited, nervous, and extremely grateful to share that I am published! I feel like I birthed a child. Please handle it with care.

                        This last June, I was honored to attend PwC's 3rd Annual Women’s Consulting Experience. Due to Covid-19, we unexpectedly shifted from a weekend in Lake Tahoe to a completely online learning experience. This seamless transition showed us how versatile and dependable PwC could be. I was able to gain invaluable insight of the work environment and what to expect as a woman in consulting. I felt supported and seen.

                        I am excited to announce that I will be continuing my journey with PwC for the summer of 2021 as a Technology Consulting Intern in the Salesforce division. During a time of such uncertainty for what’s ahead, I am grateful to be joining a company that is committed to its people and its diversity.

                        I know that these are difficult times for many of us so making this my first ever LinkedIn post feels more unnerving than usual. I want my network to not feel alone and discouraged. Behind every celebratory post is a hard job search process but LinkedIn makes it seem all too easy. Please feel free to contact me regarding anything.

                        Thank you to Katie Kleiboeker, Raj Basak, Elneeta Vandana and so many others who helped me throughout this process and for the warm welcome.

                    <p style="font-size: 13px; text-align: center">May 5, 2020</p>

                    <p>
                        This Spring 2020 semester I was fortunate enough to have had the opportunity to participate in the USC + Deloitte Technology Consulting Diversity Mentorship program.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I first heard of this program mid-January-ish in the form of a forwarded email from my business communication strategy professor (shoutout Stacy!). In retrospect, the email hit my inbox at the perfect timing. It’s a little unfitting I guess to say “perfect” timing because it was actually the time of the school year where I was feeling pretty… imperfect. I was lacking inspiration and feeling discouraged after the brutal interview season for software engineering positions last fall. I was beginning to question what exactly I was looking for career-wise. As a computer science and business administration major, I often found myself in the middle of two vastly different and competitive fields. In either field I felt I was never too hot, never too cold, just lukewarm. So when the email hit my inbox I thought, technology and consulting? That sounds about right. And I took the chance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Reflecting back, I am thankful that I took that chance. It’s easy to stay where you are comfortable, do the work assigned, and carry on with your day, but if I’ve learned anything at all it’s that those chances you take make more of an impact on your college experience than anything academic and traditional. Despite unexpectedly going virtual half-way through the program, our mentors made an effort to keep in to touch and make the best of the situation. Without this program I would not have been able to immerse myself in the welcoming environment and meet dedicated professionals and peers like I did at Deloitte. I want to especially thank my mentor, Jackie Kim, for being so supportive and caring. I have become more comfortable in asking for help and resources through her mentorship. It almost feels taboo to say you need help, but it really showed that professionals have been in your shoes and are willing to help. I’ve also learned more about myself through Deloitte’s Business Chemistry test (which now I have added to my obsessive list of personality indicators, following the MBTI test, SDI test, and astrology). I am a guardian with integrator tendencies meaning I am detail-oriented, methodical, and practical while striving for team harmony. But perhaps most importantly, I have finally come to peace and ended the two-year mental debate of changing my major. I’ve come to the conclusion that the two aspects of my major aren’t vastly different after all; they intersect at all points of the real world. My technical background becomes my strongest asset as a business professional and my creative business background enhances my software engineering approach in the bigger picture. As cheesy as it sounds, maybe I am never too hot and I am never too cold, but I am... just right? 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To Deloitte and to all my mentors, thank you for the wonderful learning experience. I really do credit this program for reviving my motivation and career aspirations. I cannot wait to grow and further explore the technology consulting world and more!
