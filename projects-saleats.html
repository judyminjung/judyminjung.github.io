                        <h2>DESCRIPTION: </h2>
                        <p>This is a course project from University of Southern California Viterbi School of Engineering CSCI 201 course (Spring 2020). 
                                After a stressful and sweaty pitch, the Council of SAL is satisfied with your orderscheduling prototype demo application and has unanimously decided to give you the
                                green light to fully implement your application. This involves pulling real data from
                                Yelp, issuing orders from SalEats HQ to drivers in real time over the network, and
                                chaining orders for drivers, much like some other food delivery application whose
                                name shall not be mentioned. A successful implementation will gain you 5 points and
                                possibly a good word from the director.
                                <br><br>
                                In addition to reading in data from a hard-coded text file, you will use the Yelp API to
                                retrieve restaurant data. In other words, the restaurant data (i.e. address,
                                coordinates, etc.) should now be pulled from this API, and you will only have to read
                                from the text file for the schedule of orders. 
                                <br><br>
                                In this assignment, you will create two different programs - a server and a client. You
                                will implement a networked delivery system where clients (which represent drivers)
                                receive orders from the server (which represents the headquarters), and the drivers
                                will deliver the orders to the appropriate restaurants. If it seems counterintuitive, you
                                can think of it as a backwards food delivery system, where food is delivered to
                                restaurants. Alternatively, your drivers are delivering ingredients for the orders to the
                                restaurants.
